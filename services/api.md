# API service

The API service is likely the most boring part of the new infrastructure. It will still follow Ripple's modelling for the time being, until we reach a position where hanayo can be rewritten and then we will switch to our own structure.

This service will be an entire mirror of Ripple API's endpoints, just to fit with the new infrastructure's database.
